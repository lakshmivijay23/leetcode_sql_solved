Write a solution to report the customer ids from the Customer table that bought all the products in the Product table.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Customer table:
+-------------+-------------+
| customer_id | product_key |
+-------------+-------------+
| 1           | 5           |
| 2           | 6           |
| 3           | 5           |
| 3           | 6           |
| 1           | 6           |
+-------------+-------------+
Product table:
+-------------+
| product_key |
+-------------+
| 5           |
| 6           |
+-------------+
Output: 
+-------------+
| customer_id |
+-------------+
| 1           |
| 3           |
+-------------+
Explanation: 
The customers who bought all the products (5 and 6) are customers with IDs 1 and 3.


-----------------------------------SOLUTION---------------------------------------------

select customer_id
from Customer
group by customer_id
having count(distinct product_key) = (
    select count(product_key)
    from Product
);



Explanation:

WHERE product_key IN (SELECT product_key FROM Product)

Ensures we only consider valid products in the Product table.

GROUP BY customer_id

Aggregate purchases per customer.

COUNT(DISTINCT product_key)

Counts the number of unique products each customer bought.

HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT product_key) = (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Product)

Only include customers whose count matches the total number of products.

This will return exactly the customers who bought all products.
